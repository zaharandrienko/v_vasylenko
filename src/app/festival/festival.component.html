The festival founded by Vasyl Vasylenko in 1998 in the city of Odessa is one of the most prestigious forums of classical music in Ukraine as well as an only opera art festival of international level held in the country.<br>The name of the festival has a deep symbolic meaning since the main idea of the festival is saving and promoting the renaissance of the world architectural masterpiece – Odessa Opera Theatre, which is the architectural “crown” of the city, its visiting card. This “crown” with its internal gold decor glorified on its stage the king of tenors Enrico Caruso, the baritones – Tito Ruffo, the basses - Fyodor Shalyapin, the sopranos - Solomiya Krushelnitska and many others. Thanks to the efforts of maestro Vasyl Vasylenko, ZOLOTA KORONA festival was set up during one of the most difficult periods in the life of the theatre –in the period of its total reconstruction. The festival like a spiritual bell managed to attract the close attention of the world’s community to the problems of Odessa opera theatre – the most precious diamond in the opera crown of Ukraine. The legend of opera art, the Opera Diva Irina Arkhipova blessed the festival. In her opening speech to the festival, she exclaimed: “I am so happy that the queen of the marine cities – Odessa –has been crowned with the highest symbol of power over people – the gold opera crown! The beautiful city – with its more than 200-year history has gained this right –to wear the opera crown, which is confirmed by the Pleiades of brilliant names connected with Odessa!”</p>
